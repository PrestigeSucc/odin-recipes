# odin-recipes

A site that showcases my favorite recipes

In this project, I will be making a website to show what my favorite dishes are.

After completion of project: I have learned quite a bit, I have engrained the use of <a href> <h1.....> <p> <ul> <ol> <img> <strong> in my head. I have also learned how to use git somewhat more efficiently, and grew my research skills a bit. I thank the Lord for showing me this curriculum and I pray that what im doing is in his will, I shall also be praying over the curriculum contributors and people taking this curriculum. Have a blessed day!!
